# Refrigeration equipment ultracheap IoT monitoring

The main goal of this project is to create a cheap solution that will allow you to control the safety of food in refrigerators and freezers.


## Main components used in this design are:

1. (Optional) Thin wires to pass refrigerator seal
2. ESP32 development board
3. Any USB power supply / charger
4. DS18B20 waterproof sensor with wires
5. 4.7k resistor

Required tools:
1. Stationery knife
2. Soldering iron with accessories (soldering wire and flux)

2. https://www.katranji.com/Item/ARDUINO-WIFI-BT-ESP32-WROOM (Most similar boards are ok. Highly preferable if your board have "User LED" to indicate current status. )

4. https://www.katranji.com/Item/SENSOR-TEMPERATURE-DS18B20 (Attention, ask seller about polarity, as wires color different from seller to seller.)
5. https://www.katranji.com/Item/Resistor-Carbon-0-5W-5%25-4K7 (This one a bit bigger, but will work. You can buy a kit also, with smaller resistors of different values)
